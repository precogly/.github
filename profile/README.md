**Explorations at the intersection of threat modeling and generative AI**

## What We're Working On

We're experimenting with new approaches to make threat modeling more scalable and trustworthy for modern AppSec teams.

Developers won't do traditional threat modeling - it's too time-consuming and complex. AI-powered approaches lack trust. We're exploring what comes next.

## Who We Are

Founded by [Vikram](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vikramadityanarayan/), a CTMP (Certified Threat Modeling Professional) and AI engineer interested in building threat modeling tools developers actually want to use.
