# Precogly

**Building open-source, agentic threat modeling tools for AI-era AppSec teams**

We're building explainable, trustworthy, high signal-to-noise threat modeling tools that combine Large Language Models with deterministic rule engines — giving security teams both speed and confidence. 


## Who We Are

Precogly is an open-source initiative creating trustworthy, explainable threat modeling tools for modern AppSec teams. We believe automated threat modeling shouldn't be a black box.
The lead developer for Precogly projects is [Vikram](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vikramadityanarayan/).

## Our Mission

Make threat modeling scalable without sacrificing trust — by combining AI with transparent, auditable reasoning.

## The Problem We're Solving

AppSec leads keep telling us:

> * Threat modeling is one of the highest ROI activities for our AppSec team.
> * Ideally we'd run a threat model for every user story — especially now, with AI-driven features shipping fast.
> * But we can't, because developers won't do threat modeling themselves, and our AppSec team is resource-constrained.
> * We want to use AI, but…
>   * How can we be sure the threat models are any good? (trustworthiness)
>   * How can we know why some risks were ignored or prioritized? (explainability)
>   * The output of LLM's can be massive and finding useful info is like finding a needle in a haystack (signal-to-noise)


## Active Projects

### [Precogly Open Source](https://github.com/precogly/precogly-open-source)
An agentic threat modeling platform that combines LLMs with deterministic rule engines. Every threat and mitigation includes a reasoning trace grounded in CVE, CAPEC, MITRE ATT&CK, and OWASP.
### [ERIMAS](https://github.com/precogly/erimas) 
An early stage prototype for evaluating _emergent_ risks in multi agentic systems

*Presented at ThreatModCon 2025*

**Status**: Early stage, seeking design partners

## Coming Soon
- Precogly Abuse - Auto generation of OWASP style abuse stories
- Precogly MAESTRO - like STRIDE-GPT but for the MAESTRO framework
- Precogly CAPEC - maps threats to CAPEC 

## Get Involved

**Design Partners**: If you're an AppSec lead we'd love to get your feedback. If you are interested in contributing, we'd be delighted to have you on board.
