**Explorations at the intersection of threat modeling and generative AI**

## What We're Working On

We're experimenting with new approaches to make threat modeling more scalable and trustworthy for modern AppSec teams.

Developers won't do traditional threat modeling - it's too time-consuming and complex. AI-powered approaches lack trust. We're exploring what comes next.

## Who We Are

Founded by [Vikram](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vikramadityanarayan/), a CTMP (Certified Threat Modeling Professional) and AI engineer interested in building threat modeling tools developers actually want to use.

## Open Source Development
[Precogly](https://github.com/precogly/precogly) - this is a full-featured threat modeling platform designed for enterprise collaboration. Import and export threat models in TM-BOM format, import and export threat modeling libraries and compliance packs, work with other teams and members in your org, perform risk calculations and much much more!

## Research & Talks

[ERIMAS](https://github.com/precogly/TMC-Washington-Nov-2025) 

Early-stage research on evaluating _emergent_ risks in multi-agentic systems.

[Look, Ma. No LLM!](https://github.com/precogly/look-ma-no-llm-demo)

A fully deterministic threat modeling pipeline that uses traditional NLP + expert systems to demonstrate how threat modeling might work without LLMs.
